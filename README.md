ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @laurencp

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub, especially for software documentation. In my profile you'll find documentation samples and projects.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email [pitmanlc@gmail.com] or LinkedIn [www.linkedin.com/in/laurenpitman].

<!---
laurencp/laurencp is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
